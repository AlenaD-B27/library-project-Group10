1. Create your branch from DEVELOP branch. Name it "TS10-NUMBER-YOURNAME" --> example: TS10-324-Alena
2. Commit message should have sense --> it should contain the information about the latest changes you've made
3. PUSH! :)
4. Do not delete any existing files. Feel free to use the files which belong to you.


P.S. All the snippets are ready to use --> clean them and implement. No need to create the new Step Definitions or Pages java classes.
